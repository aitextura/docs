**What are cookies?**

The Site uses cookies—small text files that are stored in the user’s browser when visiting the site. Cookies make it possible to recognize the user’s device, ensure the proper functioning of the site and improve the functionality of services.

**Which cookies do we use**

The Contractor may use the following categories of cookies and similar technologies:

- Strictly necessary — ensure the basic operation of the Resources, security, routing, load balancing, authorization and login.
- Functional — remember your choices and settings (for example, interface language, region), improving usability.
- Analytics and performance — help analyze user behavior, collect statistics on the use of the Resources, identify errors and improve their performance.
- Marketing and targeting — used to personalize advertising, measure its effectiveness and limit frequency of display.
- Social plugins — provide integration with social networks and the ability to share content.

**Legal basis for processing**

Functional cookies are processed on the basis of the Contractor’s legitimate interests (ensuring the technical availability of the site).

Analytics and marketing cookies are processed on the basis of the personal data subject’s consent, expressed by placing the appropriate mark (checkbox) or continuing to use the site with the cookie banner activated.

**Consent management**

On your first visit to the site or when using the Resources, you will be offered a cookie management banner where you can:

- accept all cookies;
- reject all except necessary;
- choose individual categories of cookies.

You can withdraw your consent at any time via the “Cookie settings” section, which is available at the bottom of the site or in the Platform interface.

**Cookie retention period**

Session cookies are valid only during the current browser session and are deleted after it is closed.

Persistent cookies are stored on your device for a certain period (usually from 1 day to 13 months), unless otherwise required by law or their purpose.

Similar technologies (localStorage, SDK, etc.) may be stored for comparable periods or until they are deleted by the user.

**Third-party cookies**

We may use third-party services (for example, analytics systems, payment providers, advertising networks) that set their own cookies. Such parties process data either on behalf of the Contractor or as independent operators under their own privacy policies.

The list of third-party cookies used and their descriptions may be published in a separate cookie register on the site or in the consent banner.

If cookies or data collected with their help are transferred to countries that do not provide a recognized level of data protection, the Contractor applies appropriate safeguards, including the conclusion of Standard Contractual Clauses or the use of Binding Corporate Rules.

**Managing cookies**

The user has the right to disable cookies in the browser settings. This may affect the correct display of certain elements of the site and limit access to the functionality of the personal account.

**Transfer of personal data to third parties**

The Operator may transfer personal data to third parties to the extent necessary to achieve the purposes specified in this Policy. Such transfer is carried out only in cases provided for by law or if it is necessary to provide services to the user.

The Operator uses the services of third parties who process personal data on its behalf, on the basis of concluded confidentiality and data processing agreements. This is permissible if such parties:

- provide adequate data protection,
- do not use them for their own purposes,
- act strictly within the scope of the assignment.

Such recipients may include:

- payment solution providers — for accepting payments;
- providers of CRM systems and platforms for email and push mailings;
- hosting providers and persons providing technical support for the site;
- persons ensuring the legal protection of the Operator or third parties in case of violation of their rights or threat of violation of their rights, including violation of laws or regulatory documents;
- persons providing users with access to the Resources;

The Operator does not receive or store payment data (card number, CVV code, etc.). The transfer of such data is carried out directly to the relevant payment provider in compliance with PCI DSS and other standards.

In the event of disputes, threats of violation of rights or legitimate interests of the Operator or third parties, personal data may be transferred to lawyers, representatives, judicial and law enforcement authorities – within the procedure established by law.

The transfer of personal data is possible upon request and in cases explicitly provided for by the legislation of Georgia – for example, upon requests from tax authorities, the police, the court and other state authorities.

**Transfer of data outside Georgia and the EU**

Personal data may be transferred outside Georgia to countries that ensure an adequate level of data protection recognized by the legislation of the EU or Georgia. In the case of transferring data to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, the Contractor applies measures provided for by international standards (for example, the conclusion of Standard Contractual Clauses, the use of Binding Corporate Rules).

**How does the Contractor ensure the security of personal data?**

The Contractor protects personal data that it stores from disclosure, complete or partial loss, as well as unauthorized access by third parties.

To this end, the Contractor uses all necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure security and confidentiality, and constantly updates them taking into account the latest technical developments.

If a personal data breach occurs, the Contractor:

- analyzes the incident and assesses the risks to the personal data subject,
- in the event of a personal data breach that may create a high risk to the rights and freedoms of subjects, notifies not only the supervisory authority within 72 hours, but also the data subjects without undue delay,
- if necessary, notifies the personal data subject if the breach creates a significant risk of violating their rights.

**What does the Contractor not verify?**

The Contractor cannot verify and therefore relies on you that you:

- have reached the age of 14
- have provided your own accurate personal data

**How to contact the Contractor?**

For any questions regarding the processing of personal data, you can contact the Contractor at [privacy@aitextura.com](mailto:privacy@aitextura.com).
