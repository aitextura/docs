  ## Self-Learning, Partnership Program, and Agent Scheduling

  ### **Introduction**

  AI TEXTURA is becoming smarter and more autonomous. This update focuses on self-learning, flexible working hours, and better agent management.

  ### **Main Changes**

  **Self-Learning System**

  AI agents can now learn independently from your data.

  When the system is enabled, the AI:

  - Continuously builds its own knowledge base,
  - If previously it always responded, even when uncertain — now it **consults you, the owner**, whenever it’s unsure or lacks relevant knowledge,
  - After your feedback, the AI **remembers the correct approach** and applies it in the future.

  You can choose how it behaves:

  1. **Allow it to answer with a generated response** — a fun experimental mode where AI creates an answer based on generalizations.
  2. **Respond with a predefined phrase**, for example: _“I’ll check with my supervisor and get back to you shortly.”_
  3. **Stay silent** — and always contact the supervisor if it realizes it doesn’t have enough information to respond, or if the possible answer would be based on assumptions rather than verified data.

  This makes your AI more self-aware, careful in uncertain situations, and truly capable of **learning directly from you** — like an employee learning from their mentor.

  **Partnership Program**

  We’ve launched the first version of the partnership program!\
  You can now find your **Partner ID** in the settings.

  Invited users will automatically be linked to your account.

    Bonus and reward mechanics will be announced soon — stay tuned!

  **QuickStart V2**

  The updated QuickStart now automatically creates an AI agent using **version 2**.\
  It instantly:

  - Connects knowledge sources,
  - Builds a full database from your website,
  - Sets up the optimal configuration.

  All future features will also be integrated through QuickStart.

  **Automatic Channel History Cleanup**

  You can now set up automatic **chat history cleanup** after a chosen time period.\
  Perfect for keeping your workspace clean and test sessions light.

  **Agent Working Schedule**

  No more manual toggling! You can now define a **work schedule** for your agents, including:

  - Breaks,
  - Days off,
  - Special schedules for certain days.

  Agents will automatically follow the configured working hours.

  **Skill Tool Selection**

  Each skill can now include multiple tools, and you can specify **which ones will be available** to your AI.\
  This allows for more controlled and safer behavior.

  ### Fixes

  - Fixed notification issues for AI agents v2
  - Fixed agent pause behavior
  - Added multiple small improvements and optimizations
